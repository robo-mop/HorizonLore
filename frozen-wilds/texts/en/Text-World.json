    "To: all.staff\nFrom: Marni Jephords\nSubject: Addressing the rumors\n\nSome of you have overheard portions of the… let’s call them spirited… conversations I’ve been having with the charming Mr. Blevins in my office over the past week. So let’s address the honking big elephant we’re crammed into this room with: the park has been acquired by something called Firebreak, and they’re restricting access to authorized personnel. I wish I had more details to share, but those are literally the only ones I’ve been given. Upshot: this isn’t a national park anymore. No visitors means no visitor center. We’ve got two weeks.\n\nI know this is not easy. If you’re like me, this place represents something bigger and more important than a paycheck. Believe me, I am right there with you. When I say that this park is the most beautiful place in America, it’s not PR and it’s not hype. It breaks my heart to think that nobody will be around to applaud Old Faithful or stare into the Beauty Pool. But this is where we find ourselves.\n\nI realize there’s a temptation to check out and give up, but I really really need your help over the next two weeks. Tours will continue through Friday, so I’m going to need guides. And even though regular ops at the gift shop are suspended, we’ve got a ton of surplus merch to box up and ship back to manufacturers, including about a bazillion unsold MonRec holofigurines (yes, MonRec wants everything but the display figs back, no I can’t imagine why either).\n\nPlease, you guys. Just give me two more weeks of your time. I can’t shut this place down alone.\n\nBest,\nMarni",
    "World’s Last Grizzly Dies in National Park\n\nMAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS, WY -  November 23, 2051\n\nToday, a continent joins hands in grieving the loss of an iconic species. Sergeant Woolyknickers, the world’s last known grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), was found dead by Yellowstone Park rangers at the confluence of Yellowstone River and Thorofare Creek. The sentimental explanation for his demise is heartbreak: his mate, Elvira, was felled by a viral infection a few months prior.\n\nDNA samples were taken from both bears during their stay at Chicago’s Lincoln Park Zoo in 2050, but efforts to clone them have proven unsuccessful. Zookeepers reintroduced the pair into the wild several months ago in hopes that a large outdoor territory would encourage them to produce cubs.  \n\nConservation efforts at the turn of the century met with some success in restoring the bears; in 2017, the species was delisted as endangered by the United States Interior Department. But a diminishing food supply and shortened hibernation periods still threatened, and their numbers dwindled rapidly in the Die-Off era.\n\nThe grizzly joins an ever-growing list of North American species gone extinct, alongside the cougar, the [DATA CORRUPTED]",
    "To: Shelly Guerrera-McKenzie\nFrom: Laura Vogel\nSubject: Emissions joyride\n\nOkay, girl - you are NEVER going to guess what happened on my way home last night.\n \nFirst thing, I heard this sound like a herd of killer bees escaping out of a tin can. Then there was this weird light through the trees. I was totally hoping it was aliens, but nah, it was one of those old blue-spectrum LEDs. Looked super creepy on the snow. \n\nAs it got closer, I heard some yahoo letting out this weird guttural man-shriek, as if he were doing some macho primal scream therapy. Ya know, with 1000 RPMs between his legs.\n\nSaid yahoo was none other than Dod Blevins, our new “Director of Security” or whatever his twenty-dollar title is. He was actually riding an old snowmobile! They’re like a thousand times more polluting than a combustion-era car. My expert professional opinion: Blevins is a grade-A douchecanoe. \n\nI decided not to sic the security bot on his flabby rear. After all, he’s practically our boss for the next two weeks. But Shells, you might want to take a bathroom break now, because you’re going to lose it when you find out what I did instead.\n\nI was standing right near one of the trail signs and I could tell Blevins was headed for me, so I reprogrammed the sign to swap directions between Fairy Falls and Purple Mountain. Wicked, right? You’d never get a snowmobile up there. I hope he bailed out hard and had to walk back to the lodge. \n\nGuess I’ll be filing my very first incident report right before this whole thing shuts down forever! I could let it slide like usual, but then where’s the fun, Shells? WHERE IS THE FUN?\n\nL.",

    "Park Weekly Report\nFor July 9-15, 2045\n\n[DATA CORRUPTED] …calving has begun. Cow elk may be hostile during calving season. Do not approach within 25 yards of elk at this time.\n\nFire Security\nDue to recent cool and damp weather, fire danger downgraded from MODERATE to LOW. No restrictions on campfires. \n\nRobot Activity\nSeven additional complaints were logged regarding the behavior of “Smokey” (Hestia-class firefighting robot) toward campers in the park. Despite being programmed to reflect current weather conditions, Smokey snuffed several campfires lit within designated fire rings while playing back the recorded message intended for conditions of SEVERE fire danger. \n\nOn Friday, Smokey did not return to the robot stowage shed at the time of park closure. Rangers located him near the North Entrance, dumping ice into designated swimming areas of the hot spring. Resisting all attempts at containment, he acted aggressively toward the rangers and was disabled with a hunting rifle by the Site Supervisor. \n\nA Faro technician will arrive on Monday to evaluate Smokey. \n\n--Milton Dalley, Park Ranger",
    "“Wheel of Life” Behind California Terror Attack\n\nBEVERLY HILLS, CA – March 14, 2044\n\nIn a statement released yesterday, the radical group “Wheel of Life” has claimed responsibility for last week’s terror attack, which has generated fear and uncertainty throughout Los Angeles County. \n\nThree suicide bombers detonated lethal explosives on the grounds of the Juventas Center, a luxury clinic dedicated to regeneration and life-extension therapies. As well as killing five clinic staff, the attack claimed the life of tech billionaire Aubrey Hopkins, funder of a research project on salamander biology that led to the first successful human longevity treatments. Hopkins himself had been experimenting with the treatments since the early phases of the project.\n\nThe expense associated with these treatments has thus far made them available only to the world’s most affluent. Their use by the rich has sparked widespread controversy, serving as fuel for aggressive responses like those carried out by Wheel of Life.\n\n“Aging and death flow from the spring of renewal that makes us human. The extension of life and youth by false means degrades our essential nature and brings spiritual corruption. Those who perished last week spent their lives to fill the gap dividing rich and poor,” read their statement in part. \n\nThe group’s role in the in the bombing was already suspected, as multiple witnesses recounted the shouting of [DATA CORRUPTED]",
    "As the Waters Recede, the People Return\n\nSINGAPORE - May 5, 2043\n\nA large, pink-tinted rock marks the summit of Bukit Timah Hill, Singapore’s highest point, at one time 164 meters above sea level. Charmaine Lo records a self-holo next to the rock, her bright smile contradicted by nervous fidgeting with her prismatic fake nails and ‘30s-style subdermal jewelry. “I thought I’d never see this place again. I still can’t believe it’s real,” she marvels. \n\nProud Bukit Timah has stood firm against time and weather, but the rest of Singapore has fared less well. With approximately a third of the island nation at less than 5 m above sea level, Singaporeans like Charmaine were forced to abandon their homes as inexorable waters leached away their foundations throughout the Snoring ‘20s. \n\nNow, the surviving members of Charmaine’s family are returning, alongside many others. As global temperatures and sea levels stabilize, people come by air or by water. Some seek refuge from the deleterious effects of the Citarum River tragedy, whose costs still reverberate today. All hope to build new lives atop the collapse of the once stable and prosperous country. \n\nSingapore represents one of many states abandoned by their citizens in the aftermath of heavy coastal flooding.  Questions surrounding ownership are difficult to answer. Government and law enforcement personnel fled far in advance of the country’s devastation, and documentation of title is scattered at best. The plot of land on which Charmaine’s childhood home once sat had belonged to the Lo family for almost a [DATA CORRUPTED]",
    "Sylvester Malenowski, Personal Log #041\n\n[DATA CORRUPTED] approved my chromatic preservation proposal! Blevins is furious, of course, but any expenditure that doesn’t directly benefit his security team makes him furious, so it’s hard to work up the energy to care. In any case, I think we’re a go! Now, if I’m right, with some relatively minor tweaks to the bacterial and pH contents of the springs, we should be able to cool them down without losing any of the coloration that makes them so special. \n\nThe water at the centers of the pools should remain entirely sterile, and the cyanobacteria at the edges ought to have the exact same photosynthetic reaction. This is a real win. I mean, there will come a day when this park is open to people again. I have to believe that. And when it is, those people will want to see the prismatic springs. \n\nYou know, it occurs to me… When all this is said and done, you’ll be able to swim right through those springs. It’ll be like taking a warm bath.",
    "Will Tourists Return to the Park?\n\nDate: March 1, 2045\nContact: Marni Jephords\n\nMAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS, WY - Roosevelt \nArch soars over the road to the North Entrance of Yellowstone National Park. In the park’s heyday, more than 100,000 visitors each month passed below this arch on their way to visit such celebrated landmarks as the geyser “Old Faithful,” the mighty Yellowstone River, and the vibrant Grand Prismatic Pools. \n\nSince President Ulysses S. Grant signed an Act of Dedication to create Yellowstone National Park in 1872, it has survived forest fires, world wars, and earthquakes to be enjoyed by nature-lovers for more than 150 years, until environmental concerns drove the entire world into chaos. \n\nIn 2031, the federal government withdrew funding from the park and transferred ownership to the State of Wyoming, after which the rate of visitation slowed to a trickle. Old Faithful’s dependable eruptions went unobserved, and Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel, where guests once devoured bison meatballs, sat empty for years, blankly staring across an expanse of wilderness.\n\nThe ‘30s saw several attempts to privatize the park. Many companies, including the powerful Faro Automated Solutions, made bids to purchase its land. After Faro’s proposal was abruptly withdrawn in 2040, weakened federal protections on public parks were restored, coinciding with the easing of climate change through technological means. \n\nAs the world claws back, so too will Yellowstone. As of next week, the park will be restored to the United States government, with Faro Automated Solutions returning to finance the handoff, as well as providing funding for as-yet-unspecified new facilities. Tourism is already up in advance of these proceedings, and soon, Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel and the park’s walkways will bustle with life again. We look forward to your [DATA CORRUPTED]",

In among the busyness of those appointments, he sat down for a very special dinner with a very special family – the Lafayettes. \n\nEveryone knows the Lafayettes, of course. Who hasn’t ridden one of their trails astride a sturdy paint pony, played chase-the-gopher in their fields, or chowed down on a thick, juicy steak coming off their farm? Their solid-gold reputation is what brought the Governor to their table two nights ago. \n\nIt’s no secret that raising cattle has gotten ever more difficult and expensive. A long time past are the days of herds stretching to the horizon. Why, nearly the only people who still keep cows are dude ranchers!\n\nThe Lafayettes tried their best, God bless them, but they were smart enough to see what’s coming down the country lane, and banished their barns in favor of a shiny new meat-growing operation a few months back.
