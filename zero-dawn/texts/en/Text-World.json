    "<bold>Climate refugee museum opens in London\n\nLONDON – May 8, 2060 – </bold>Celebrated poet and environmental activist Diego Abela fought back tears today in a speech delivered on the steps of the newly opened Climate Refugee Memorial Museum in London. \n\n“I was nineteen in 2033, when the waves rose up and swallowed the Azores,” Abela said. “The waves swallowed my home. The next decade of my life, I would spend behind the walls of the Thamesmead Emergency Relocation Facility, starving at day, freezing at night, contending with scorn, disgust, and abuse from the very people charged to care for me.”  \n\nAbela went on to discuss the still-controversial police actions of 2038. “In the Thamesmead Uprising—and it was an uprising, not a “riot,” as your holo-pages still call it – I saw men and women crushed beneath the jackboot heel of a panicking power structure. Friends. Lovers. I saw them die. My experience is not singular. There were a thousand Thamesmeads. We must not allow this dark moment in our species' history to become a shrugging footnote.”\n\nSecond-Chance-Party-UK Prime Minister Sally Bowyer was among the first to tour the new museum. “Our nation totally needs this. What climate refugees endured was really bad. It completely deserves a real-space museum so we can literally stand in their remembrance and be aware and create a brighter world than what came before.” \n\nIn contrast, opposition candidate Nigel Kearns-Bailey of the Fair-Chance-UK party was fiercely critical of the museum and its spokesperson. “More than a billion persons perished in the Great Die-Off. Thanks to the generosity of the UK – our generosity – Diego Abela was not one of them. If he so hates the fact that we saved his life and gave him shelter for a decade, I suggest he wend his way down to the Thames and jump in. It’s never too late to drown. In fact, I...

    "<bold>Haere Mai program attracting young people back to New Zealand</bold>\n\n<bold>AUCKLAND – January 1, 2062 –</bold> Analice Cameron was barely three years old when her family fled the 2036 Submergence. Now she’s come back. \"We joke it's not New Zealand anymore, it's New-New-New Zealand. But that's just having a laugh. For the first time in my life, I feel like I'm home.\"  \n\nCameron is one of approximately seventeen thousand young Kiwi transplants participating in the New Zealand government's Haere Mai Program, which offers tax incentives to displaced New Zealanders for returning home. The program is the brainchild of PM Tama Ngata, who is widely credited with facilitating the revitalization of Auckland and Christchurch through risky, post-Citarum River Disaster investment in the nanotech construction industry.  \"It's time to let the world know we're still here,\" said Ngata of the program. \"Our nation is strong.

    "<bold>Editorial: Overturning Schott v. Frost is a pipe dream\n\nJanuary 9, 2061 –</bold> Of all the tedious and repetitive talking points that became the touchstones of the last presidential election, none were more empty or jejune than the debate over Schott v. Frost, the Supreme Court decision that granted corporations the right to run for and hold political office through proxy candidates. Nobody could be blamed for thinking this was an actual issue. This was the race, after all, that brought us such deliciously dramatic holoclips as Lacy Almodovar asking to “speak to your [Barney Atami's] manager,” and Atami declaring Almodovar a “dangerous anarchist” for her apparently anti-corporate stance. But for all of Almodovar's fiery rhetoric, the fact remains that the single largest donor to her campaign fund was arguably the second most powerful corporate entity in the world, Metallurgic International.

Hello, ladies and gentlemen, you're listening to the Jeff Andreatis Show, brought to you, of course, by the Rational Capitalist Immersicast Network, and... Let's, you know what, let's just jump right into this, there is this trend... of young people... who are immigrating to China, of all places... for work! They're choosing to work in China's factories – as manual labor! I just... There's this article today, posted on Cafe Intel—one of these “cultural trend” fluff pieces these progs are so fond of—reporting that immigration to China by American citizens has... doubled... since 2050. Now, why is that? Well, Cafe Intel would have you believe that “corporate sovereignty,” the left's current favorite bogeyman, and increased automation have limited their opportunities here in America. Folks, I know I don't have to tell the world's smartest radio audience, but that... is... absurd. Do you know what's limited these young peoples' opportunities? Poor decision making. Nothing else. Right now, at this very moment in history, the best instruction in the history of education is available to anyone who has the nuts to apply for a modest loan. But nooooo, these... infants, these... spoiled “better-back-when-ers” with their totally inherited, totally unexamined prejudice against the amazing work being done by corporations around the globe, and in this country specifically, they say, “Oh, no, I won’t go to a corporate school! I don't want to go learn something useful from someone successful! I want to move to Vancouver! I want to major in Bashcore Studies from Stoned-Out-Of-My-Mind-On-Snake University!” What, exactly, did you think was going to happen when you graduated with your Creative Expression degree from some east coast, left-wing edu-enclave that nobody's ever even heard of?

    "<bold>Ten years after mustering out, UK vets struggle to make ends meet</bold>\n\n<bold>WATFORD – May 1, 2062</bold> – Ten years ago, Lance Corporal Rosalind Jeffreys received her discharge paperwork at a ceremony that marked the “decommissioning” of all human combat forces in the Royal Air Force. Today, Jeffreys and her husband live with another former military family in a small two-bedroom flat in Watford. \n\n\"Well, it's not ideal,\" says the good-humored Jeffreys, who supplements her military pension as a bartender. \"But it's sort of an English tradition, isn't it, resenting elected officials for breaking promises. We make do.\"\n\nJeffreys isn't the only one having to \"make do.\" According to a study conducted by the Social Welfare Research Institute, 75% of veterans polled report they are unable to cover living expenses with their pension income alone. Researcher Harold Adeyemi explains, \"It's a complicated situation. Ten years, ago, few people anticipated just how high and how quickly the cost of living would rise. As funding of the NHS has gradually been siphoned into the coffers of corporate healthcare providers, it's become increasingly difficult for veterans to access medical care. Those are just two factors of probably thousands contributing to straits becoming so dire for our veterans. But I suppose that's little comfort to someone who's struggling to feed their children.\"\n",

The much smaller Colombian corporation defended their Bahamanian facilities for longer than early projections anticipated, thanks in part to robot lease agreements with the Indian military, but was ultimately forced to retreat in the face of a larger and better-equipped acquisitions force. \n\nHartz has announced intentions to holo-cast an “immersive extravaganza highlighting the most explosive moments of robot on robot conflict!” However, as of press time, no scheduled date had been set.",
    "<bold>Editorial: Does the First Amendment apply to virtual spaces?\n\nApril 29, 2063 – </bold>Last week, in one of the biggest synchronized police actions in US history, the homes of more than seven hundred private citizens were raided, and more than five hundred arrests were made for the crime of “inciting criminal behavior using private informational processes.” \n\nIf you've been paying attention over the past nine years, you'll know how to parse the above legal word soup: those raided are accused of participating in a virtual anti-corporate sovereignty rally, this time at the holo-net headquarters of Sterling-Malkeet. \n\nWatching five-hundred people, many of them bloodied and terrified, hauled from their homes by police “SWATbots” is—understandably and rightfully—horrifying to a lot of people, but this is nothing new. As far back as 2054, when the first major arrest of virtual protesters occurred over the occupation of Metallurgic International's holographic customer service center, pundits and courts have engaged in the debate over whether or not the internet constitutes a public space, and is therefore legally required to oblige peaceable assembly. \n\nLegislation simply hasn't kept up with the advances of the holo-net, and that’s no accident. It serves the interests of Sterling-Malkeet and Metallurgic and their corporate ilk to treat the holo-scape, not as a public space, but (in the words of Metallurgic-backed Senator Gerard O'Neil) “an array of privately owned information processes.” The same O'Neil — [DATA CORRUPTED]",

I remain steadfast. Father Globe is in His death throes. He is ready to die. But you scorn Father Globe. Rather than help Him slough off filth, you condescend, insist you know what’s best. Now, you've had your 'Claw-back,' and think you will live forever. But the grave remains no less spacious than before.” \n\nChoi was serving a life sentence at PuniTech Inc.'s Alpha Campus for engineering the “Doom Plague” viral cocktail that scourged New York, London, Moscow, Tokyo, and Shanghai in 2039. The decision to imprison Choi for life rather than execute her was met with widespread outrage, but information she provided in exchange for the sentence led to the arrests of sixteen higher ranking members of the terrorist cult and, ultimately, Naysay Doom's collapse. \n",

Here.\" He pops one of the earbuds out, wipes it down on his t-shirt, and hands it to me... to stick in the physical ear behind my Faro Focus 6d. \n\nFor a while, we sit together this way, listening to archaic pip-pop as Sukhumvit Road comes to life. It's early here. And let me clarify; when I say here, I really mean HERE. This is not a virtual environment crafted to mimic the seedy exoticism that Bangkok evokes in so many western imaginations. I had to hop a vert to get here, and I will have to hop another to get back home. \n\nEddie is one of a growing number of young people rejecting the ubiquity of holotourism in favor of \"hard travel.\" Every year—driven at least in part by a youth culture that prizes authenticity over convenience—a growing number of twentysomethings pack actual bags, board actual verts, and set off to explore distant destinations without the benefit of technological augmentation. \n\n\"You gotta feel it,\" says Eddie, gesturing vaguely to the scene before us: souvenir stands, tuk-tuks (self- and human-guided both), and open-air pad-thai stands, all of it thronged with young dudes and ladies affecting the same anachronistic style as Eddie. \"Like, you know all this used to be underwater? I got a buddy out in Phuket, right? Spent two years rebuilding one of the temples out there. Is that the sort of experience you'd get through your Focus?\"\n\nSome part of me can't shake the feeling that Eddie's overtures toward \"realness\" are just an affectation, that he's no more than another dopey rich kid desperate to differentiate himself from his parents' (my) generation.

Behind him, so brazen that it almost comes off as a joke, there's a poster cycling between images of mist-shrouded mountains, verdant rice fields, and an ocean sunset that reads: \"\"See Java as it was meant to be seen.\"\" \n\nThe poster stands as a potent symbol of everything Pasnarov is striving against in We Were Indonesia. Through repurposed news segments, contemporary interviews, and exhaustive personal analysis, Pasnarov explores the history and legacy of the 2041 nanotech disaster at the Citarum River. By the time his narrative concludes, he has not just condemned those responsible for Citarum, but indicted our collective habit of shrugging off the “trial-and-error” horrors of the 2040s in favor of a simplified, hagiographic account of the great “Claw-Back.” \n\nPasnarov's retro sensibilities and obsession with linear, two-dimensional film techniques have long been the favorite talking points of his critics, but here his passion drives him to wield established techniques with devastating surgical precision.

    "<bold>Editorial: What does Odyssey say about who we value?\n\nMarch 8, 2041 –</bold> If you’ve been paying attention to all the public outrage in response to last week’s announcement of the Odyssey project, you’d be forgiven for mistaking the proposed colony ship for a gold-plated space chariot that the world's trillionaires are conspiring to use to escape the climate catastrophe, leaving the rest of us to choke and drown and starve while the richies rocket off to Sirius. 1Earth spokesman Azar Safavi went so far as to say, “The ability to drive the planet nearly to extinction and then even consider leaving it behind is the sole provenance of the obscenely, criminally rich.” Dander up, hackles raised? You bet. Only problem is – Azar’s got it all wrong. \n\nThe Odyssey is not a cosmic escape pod for CEOs. It’s a rare instance of long-term thinking in the midst of our collective disaster. Even if every aspect of the project goes swimmingly – which we all know will never happen – the ship won’t even launch from orbit until 2080, by which time – let’s face it – our species will either have found a way to reverse the climate, or will have perished. \n\nNor is the Odyssey a vanity project funded by the preposterously wealthy. It is, rather, a (yet again rare) instance of an international project, co-founded by five nations (U.S., the Western European Alliance, India, China, and Japan). Yes, the project will accept donations by wealthy individuals, but donations will not “buy a seat” on the ship. The vast majority of the Odyssey’s human passengers will not be old, rich, and smug, but very young – as in embryonic.

    "<bold>Interview: Dalgaard opens up about Far Zenith—a little\n\nFebruary 28, 2061 –</bold> Osvald Dalgaard never stops smiling. Before last month, the Danish tech wunderkind was known primarily as the creator and CEO of AllSeeing.holo, the world's most popular holofilm sharing service. But for the past few weeks, Dalgaard has been the public face of Far Zenith, the self-described “futurist consortium” responsible for reviving the Odyssey colony ship project. Osvald seems an unlikely spokesman for a shadowy group of billionaires – but maybe that’s the point. He is bright-eyed, handsome in a nerdy, rail-thin way, endlessly enthusiastic. When I arrive at the AllSeeing offices for our interview, he glances behind me as if waiting for a holocamera crew to swarm in in my wake. “So this will be published as text? An article?” He speaks English with barely any accent at all. I nod, and his smile (impossibly) widens. “That is just incredible. Really, real super quaint. Love it.” \n\nOsvald's countenance may be exuberantly inviting, but the organization for which he serves as mouthpiece is anything but. To date, he is the only publicly acknowledged member of Far Zenith, which claims to comprise seventy-seven of the world's wealthiest persons. “It's more fun this way, don't you think?” asks Osvald. “The mystery. It's... what would you call it... It's stagecraft. Far Zenith is as much performance art as it is a functional futurist endeavor. Although, it's that as well. I can tell you that there's nothing sinister about it. We are devoted not only to extending humanity's legacy beyond this solar system, but also to making the world... sexier, I suppose. More interesting. Far Zenith is science and transcendence, but it's also fashion. Rock and roll. You see?” \n\nWell, no, I don't, but I don't tell Osvald that. Instead, I ask him a question that's been on the minds of a lot of people since Far Zenith purchased the unfinished colony ship. If the combined efforts of the US, China, India, Japan, and the Western European Alliance couldn't finish the Odyssey, what makes Far Zenith think it can? \n\n“Ah,” he says. “Here's where I get to blow your mind. Very exciting. We are not interested in escaping a dying world. For us, this is not an act of panic or, ah... adrenal survival reflex. The Odyssey, under the stewardship of Far Zenith, will be a triumph, not a retreat. This is why we will succeed. Why we already have succeeded, really.” Osvald makes it hard to press for answers. His answers are labyrinthine, but something in his tone and his body language makes them feel downright linear. How much of this is a put-on and— [DATA CORRUPTED].",
    "<bold>Far Zenith: Odyssey ready for launch \"imminently\"\n\nHIGH ORBIT, April 1, 2065 – </bold>“We're not blind to the irony of making this announcement on April First,” said Far Zenith spokesman Osvald Dalgraad in a live holocast this morning. “But I can assure you: this is not a prank. Construction on the Odyssey is complete. All systems appear to be entirely operational. In short: we're ready to go. All that remains is to run comprehensive system tests – especially of the bleeding-edge anti-matter pulse drives – and resolve various minor logistical details.” \n\nThe announcement comes a mere four years after Far Zenith's purchase of the derelict Odyssey, abandoned in orbit in July 2057. Dalgraad wrapped the announcement by fielding questions from press log-ons. Of the size of the crew, Dalgraad said, “Adult humans? Very minimal. Fifty to sixty individuals. But of course the living and breathing folks aren’t the real headcount here – that’d be the 200,000 zygotes in cryo-storage.” When asked about the projected launch date, Dalgraad answered, “We’re absolutely going to hit this July date. Obviously we would have loved another few years to train our crew, but with the situation on Earth deteriorating as it is, we’ve decided to move aggressively.” \n\nAsked if he has any parting words for humanity, Osvald nods solemnly. “We share the hope that Zero Dawn will reverse Earth’s terrible crisis. Either way, we at Far Zenith are committed to doing all we can to ensure that humanity has a future, if not on its home planet, then elsewhere.” \n\nAs to the remaining seventy-six members of Far Zenith and their identities, Dalgraad remained characteristically coy. “They're fine,” he said. “Thanks for asking.”"
