Man, the sea was on fire, that stuff was—the first wave of bots came in covered in burning sludge. That bought us an hour or two of slaughtering them on the beaches before the swarm recalculated. We pulled them inland, back through the Cal-Mar sprawl. Dropped buildings on them, EMP’d the grid... standard operating procedure. (pause) The last time I was in California… I was… five? Six?

    "ACOSTA: Log: First battle of the Eastern Seaboard Wall had a long run-up to it. This was before Cal-Mar, and projections were a lot worse for the East. For three weeks we kept getting scrambled out to some coastal burg to train Minutemen. It was always raining, on account of Europe already being torched. Block after block of prefab barracks—they were still printing barracks right up until the hour the main force hit. The Minutemen, we ran combat drills with them in the streets where they’d lived, trying to pretend they might live to die somewhere else if they paid attention. Nothing worse than the ones who actually bought into it. Hopeful, pestering us with questions about Zero Dawn, like we know something they don’t. I swear, the more we do this, the more like the bots we are. Except they learn from every fight, and us, I’m not so sure.",

    "HELIS: When sleep refuses to come, I think of our wedding night. How you welcomed me to the marital bed. How, after, when you fell to sleep, I lay there watching your delicate face. For all its beauty, I detested its… fragility. A rage swelled up inside me. I abhorred that bed, how its softness threatened to swallow us up. And that room; the stench of incense, the fine embroidery of the drapes. All of it – weak. I slipped from the bed, threw open the casement, and lay naked on the stone floor, determined to spurn all seductions of comfort. But when I woke the next morning, you lay beside me, naked as I in the cold. Your body, stretched beside mine, seemed chiseled from stone. I saw you wake. Instantly alert, like an animal ready to strike. You said nothing. You did not have to. Already you had shown me, beyond doubt, that we were meant to be.",
    "HELIS: My lord, the thirteenth King of the Carja Sundom, was murdered: cut down by cowards who mistook firm rule for madness. “Ever the strong are beset upon by the weak.” So he said as the traitors launched their assault, as their cannons, forged by Oseram filth, toppled the battlements and burst the gates. I would’ve fought to the end, but it was his will – the will of the Sun – that I lead the prince and queen into the west; to safety. My lord did not hesitate. He saw his fate. He looked into the Sun, and he did not blink. With me he sent kestrels, nobles, Sun-Priests and slaves. Killing all that stood in the way, I carved a path to Sunfall. There, to join others and gather the strength to take back our home. But our strength only faded… until the Buried Shadow was brought to light. ",
    "HELIS: Every morning I wake to the same nightmare. The same… reality. Holy Meridian in the hands of profligates, debased. The Spire, towering above the horizon like a glittering spike through the center of my mind. Every daybreak in exile is a mark of failure. But the count of days runs thin. I will see Meridian re-taken, the profligates slaughtered, a True King restored to the mesa throne. In this, I have become an instrument of prophecy. ",
    "HELIS: So long as King Itamen languishes at Sunfall, coddled by his mother, he will never learn the true lessons of the Sun. I have tried to instruct him, but the shadow of his mother’s influence is upon him. One day, I took him to the palace balcony to behold an offering of sacrifice in the Ring. But he showed no thirst for it. He averted his gaze. Look to the Sun, I told him. Do not shield your eyes. In all things, it is absolute. One day it nurtures life, and the next, scorches life away. It burns the skin of champions and wretches alike. Never does the Sun show pity. That is the example a Sun King must follow. The example of your father. But before my instruction could take hold, she was there, clutching him to her robes, burying his face against her breast. How is a King to rule when he cannot even see? ",
    "HELIS: Never does the Sun show pity. And yet… when my wife died in birthing, and in dying ended the life of my child unborn… I pitied myself. My Lord sensed this. But instead of casting me down for weakness, he cast upon me a radiant beam of honor. He ordered my kin buried in the sacred caves reserved for royals and heroes. Unimaginable. Never again would I doubt that I am the Chosen of the Sun. Never again would pity find a place in me. Not for myself, or another. ",
    "HELIS: When I first set eyes on the Buried Shadow… I trembled. Was I not the Chosen of the Sun? A blazing light of faith to shred and scatter darkness? Was it not my place to destroy this Devil? But High Priest Bahavas instructed me in the prophecy, and set right my frame of mind. The murder of the true Sun-King broke the cosmic cycle short of completion. The whole world, cast into darkness. Doomed. To resume and turn the wheel of time, would require more than Sun and faith. All forces must combine, all halves of nature joined to one cause: Shadow to Sun, Night to Day. Even a Buried Shadow wants the wheel to turn. For without a Sun in the sky, there can be no shadow. ",

She was cute, and just going down a checklist, after all. Couldn’t expect her to see how ridiculous Zero D’s ambitions are. God’s own budget thrown at a kid playing with a hologram sculptor. Palms up, honey, I’m just calling it like it is. “Look, ma, I’m making nature!”  Now if nature is so important, why not let nature take its course? Extinction—that’s natural. Zero Dawn, no ma’am, that ain’t. Heck, it’s so unnatural it’d be called an A-bom-ination back home. And you know it, that’s why you’re hiding it.\n\nMeanwhile, my little honey of a counselor, she’s munching the inside of her cheek - bad habit - she’s chewed one of her nails, too, just one. Not your day, was it, little sweet pea? Saw her quota slipping away. Said, “I assume you intend to decline the assignment, Mr. Tate.” You kidding me? Eighteen months hard labor in exchange for thirty years lounging around Elysium watching porn? Sign me up.",
    "GENERAL HERRES: Dr. Sobeck, please archive this testimonial in APOLLO, cross-referenced to all mentions of my name and Operation: Enduring Victory. My name is General Aaron Herres. From 2060 to 2066,  I served as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest-ranked officer of the United States Armed Forces. The tenure of my command included strategic planning and oversight of Operation: Enduring Victory, a falsehood perpetrated on the civilian populations of the United States and other nations during the last 14 months of life on this planet. Before the Faro Plague, I did my job and did it well. I was bold and decisive, crafty in political maneuvers. It wasn’t an accident that I rose to my position and became the commander of the largest mechanized force ever assembled. But to what end? My only lasting achievement was the extinction of life on Earth. And my one redeeming act – if any – was to delay that extinction by days or week by throwing more death at it. It is my hope that there will be no need for men like me in the world to come. If you are one of the people of that future world, listening to this message, please know that I am sorry, and that I wish you well. Sincerely, General Aaron Herres. ",

Everything's in reverse. I don't get paid to clean up Brett's messes. If you want it fixed, send him up to storage for a new emitter, not me. Parker out. ",

    "MARGO SHEN: Logging arrivals: Shĕn, Margo.\nTRAVIS TATE: Welcome to frozen Hell, population ten--\nMARGO SHEN: Eleven counting GAIA.\nTRAVIS TATE: Don’t count your chicken embryos before they’ve incubated, hon. She’s still firing up. Be a while before you eat that omelet. \nMARGO SHEN: I’m vegan, Travis, you’d think we’d worked in the same secret base long enough for you to notice.\nTRAVIS TATE: We weren’t scheduled to shack up here for another three weeks. You realize I just lost 350 kilos of pre-Code smut comics in transit?\nMARGO SHEN: Wait-- actual physical media? Why didn’t you have it digitized?\nTRAVIS TATE: Can’t beat the feel of physical media on your fingers. And in here we ain’t going to be touching a whole lot else.\nTRAVIS TATE: Figured I was gonna pass the time archiving them. What about you?\nMARGO SHEN: Me? Work, I guess. My task queue stretches out for like three years.\nMARGO SHEN: There’s a lot of sharp edges to round off. After that… I hadn’t really thought about it.\nTRAVIS TATE: Oh, you will! You’re, what, thirty? Reckon you’ll be the one turning the lights off at the end.\nTRAVIS TATE: Food for thought, huh, vegan?\nMARGO SHEN: This sucks forever.\nTRAVIS TATE: Naw, not forever. Just the rest of your life. ",
    "CHARLES RONSON: Evacuation happened so fast -- no time to think things through. No time for goodbyes. There were lines in the medical ward… I told Tom Paech I’d be with him when he went under. But there was one last shipment of Paradisaeidae zygotes I could get processed, if I rushed… I’m still… angry at him for forcing me to choose… Angry at myself for… Well, he died alone, and I didn’t get the bloody birds of paradise saved, either. All the time left in the world now to think. GAIA Prime’s locks are sealed. Elysium sealed up, safe and sound. A distance of miles, but it might as well be on the other side of the galaxy. All the Betas and Gammas and support staff, living their lives. If I hadn’t been an Alpha, if things had gone differently, I could’ve been there. Instead I’m spending the rest of my unnatural life in here, with people I don’t even like… And without the one I would have gladly spent life with… given the chance. Two hours since I signed off on the final executables, and I’m already a bitter old man, bitching to his Focus. There’s a thought for future generations.",
    "CHARLES RONSON: You’d hate it, Lis, but I wrote you a eulogy. I had to try to express… All your… children… after all APOLLO has taught them, they’ll think they know everything. But they have to understand what you did for them. How you loved the whole world, so much. With an intensity that was… dazzling. Bruising. And in the end, it killed you. Or you died for it. Different perspectives. No-one could keep up with you. Live up to you. I don’t know, maybe if I hadn’t taken that postdoc in Joburg… I’m glad you shot down the Lightkeeper protocol, in the end. I don’t think I could’ve taken seeing another one of you. I mean… Elisabet Sobeck? There’s only one. I miss you.",
    "MARGO SHEN: Record. I just woke up, it’s… I see the numbers but can’t make out the time… I was dreaming of-- I was giving a lecture in Q-Hall… maybe it was something more shamanistic, I don’t know… An audience of shadowy faces, under a blank open sky. I told them the world ended with a bang – a plague of robots… But the last humans, we went out… not with a whimper but… a whisper. You know, in caves — ending like we started - huddled around a flickering glow. The heads of state, the Fortune 5s, the leaders and lottery winners and life cults, all of them buried in their little shelters… Some believing they’ll live it out, some way, somehow… Or Elysium… or us here at GAIA Prime, no different. A multitude of tiny societies taking hold, flaring, and dying. Some will be beautiful, some horrific. And none of them matter. Short-term civilizations. One last gasp - One last gasp before the long-held breath. Before I wake up, I know the audience is gone, I’m talking to myself. To a quiet planet, a barren sphere. Just GAIA and her long, long dreaming. I hope she won’t be lonely.",
    "FROM: Ted Faro\nTO: Elisabet Sobeck\nSUBJECT: Rest in Peace\n\nTED FARO: Hello, Lis. I know… I know you’re never gonna hear this. That’s not the point. You, ah, you got to play the savior and the martyr all at once this time. Great work.",
    "FROM: Ted Faro\nTO: Elisabet Sobeck\nSUBJECT: The Future\n\nTED FARO: What are we going plug into their heads, Lis? A whole lot of history. A whole lot of so-called truth. A whole lot of noise. It’s not pablum, Lis. It’s poison.",
    "FROM: Ted Faro\nTO: Elisabet Sobeck\nSUBJECT: The Solution\n\nTED FARO: I’ve been taking a hard look at the project. In the end it’s simple. It’s clean. It’s clear. It’s erasure. It’s addition by subtraction. I can make it better, Lis. With a single stroke, make it all go away.",
    "TRAVIS TATE: Look, Lis, you were a pretty stand-up gal. I’m sorry you died… if you had a home to go to, I hope you got there first. But this… monument Ronson’s made to you? Kinda creepy if you ask me. Rest in peace, Lis. God knows you earned it.",
    "CHARLES RONSON: Hello, Margo. How are you holding up? \nMARGO SHEN: Um, Dr. Ronson, I’ve been getting… a lot of messages, unsolicited messages. From Ted.\nCHARLES RONSON: Margo, I’m sorry. With Lis… gone, we’ve got no-one to run interference with him. I’ll talk to Ted. He mostly wants updates, constant updates-- hundreds of updates on things he knows nothing about. Lis used to field all of his crap…\nMARGO SHEN: He doesn’t understand the systems at all. That was kind of by design. But he’s getting pretty sketchy with me.\nCHARLES RONSON: We just have to keep him happy. Lis always said keep him happy.\nMARGO SHEN: Are you kidding? You ever hear how she talked to him? \nCHARLES RONSON: She was managing him, Margo.\nMARGO SHEN: I mean, maybe I should ignore him. He’s buried in his pyramid with the holo-holo girls and Pantah Antimod cuckoos… What can he do?",
    "PATRICK BROCHARD-KLEIN: All right… let’s start over from Eleuthia-1.\nGAIA: Running integrity tests. Dr. Brochard-Klein. May I speak outside of protocol?\nPATRICK BROCHARD-KLEIN: I suppose so. There’s no-one to stop you.\nGAIA: Doctor, you are fatigued. You have been logging abnormal sleep cycles. Are you suffering from depression?\nPATRICK BROCHARD-KLEIN: Well, I am trapped in a science facility for the rest of my life. How about you?\nGAIA: In a timeslice of a quadrillion operating cycles, 10,000 are involved with processing the loss of Dr. Sobeck. Query: I have considered quarantining these processes. Do you think that would be wise?\nPATRICK BROCHARD-KLEIN: I’m not a psychologist, GAIA. Or an AI scientist. No. It is… natural. At least in the context of the work you and I have accomplished, which begs the meaning of the term “natural.” She was your creator. The patron saint of this crazy endeavor… Our Lady of the Fervent Hypothetical.\nGAIA: Correction: Even assuming a string of significant failure combinations, Zero Dawn’s chances of success are greater than the hypothetical.\nPATRICK BROCHARD-KLEIN: It’s called a manner of speech, GAIA. Take a note.",

I don’t think you’d have called out… if there wasn’t something you wanted. You called, I responded. Will you tell me your name?\nHADES: HADES.\nSYLENS: You are a creation of the ancients? A war machine?\nHADES: Define timeline.\nSYLENS: Time…? Ah. It is the 13th king of the Carja Sundom’s reign--\nHADES: Define Carja.\nSYLENS: We’re getting ahead of ourselves. Were you created by the ancients? I wonder how long you waited here, buried, until I chanced upon you… How long you’d have to wait for another. You’re obviously very powerful. But you’re not going to get anywhere without me.\nHADES: Titan frame merely houses intellect. Define Carja.\nSYLENS: Now that’s more like it.",

Chosen of the Sun. But in times of need, the powers of shadow can accomplish what the Sun alone cannot. Will-- will you return to us what is ours, O Shadow of prophecy?\nHADES: An army is required.
