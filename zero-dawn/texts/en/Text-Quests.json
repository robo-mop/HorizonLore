    "FROM: Director Evans\nTO: All\nSUBJECT: All Good Things… \n\nTo All Staff, \n\nI regret to inform you that our worst fears have been realized. The Wichita salient has collapsed, and our position will be overrun in less than twenty-four hours. \n\nAs I’m sure you understand, exfiltration transport is not available. If you wish to abandon the facility and try your luck on foot, you may do so. Lock 2 will unseal at 2100 hours and remain unsealed for fifteen minutes. Godspeed.  \n\nFor those of us who’d rather not die on our feet, there will be a gathering in the community room at 2200 hours, and Nurse Chana will make other means available. \n\nI want to underscore how proud I am of each and every person who served at this post. It is important to bear in mind that our sacrifices were not in vain. I hope that makes this a little easier.  \n\nFor months now I’ve been signing off messages as “Director Evans,” but I suppose we can dispense with such formalities now.  \n\nRespectfully, \n\nEllen\n",
    "Elisabet Sobeck (born March 11, 2020) is an American scientist, roboticist, and engineer, widely regarded as one of the greatest minds of the 21st century. Born and raised outside Carson City, Nevada, she enrolled at Stanford University at age 13, earning a BS in Experimental Physics and Computer Science at age 16. She completed her Ph.D. in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Design at Carnegie-Mellon University in 2040 and joined Faro Automated Solutions as a Junior Scientist the same year, rising quickly to Chief Scientist at the age of 22. Over the next eight years, her green robot designs played a vital role in realizing the environmental cleanup and detoxification efforts of “The Claw-back” decade, propelling FAS to the forefront of its field. In 2048, she suddenly resigned from FAS, protesting the company’s pivot to automated military technologies. In 2049, she founded Miriam Technologies, a firm devoted to “life-positive” robotics and other technologies. Miriam has since become one of the world’s largest suppliers of green robots, winning numerous awards and accolades, including the 2053 Nobel Prize for Physics and the 2056 Rachel Carson Award for Environmental Progress.",
    "Theodor “Ted” Faro (born December 24, 2013) is an American entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder of Faro Automated Solutions (FAS), the largest corporation of all time, the world’s wealthiest individual, and the first-ever trillionaire. Born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah, he enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he studied business for two years before dropping out in 2033 to start FAS. Though it struggled at first, the company broke through at the end of the troubled 2030s with its popular lines of personal servitors and bodyguard bots, then exploded when its famous line of green robots led the race to solve the climate crisis during the 2040s “Claw-back.” At the end of that decade, FAS opened a military defense branch, dominating the world market for automated military platforms by 2053. The success of FAS has made Mr. Faro the world’s best-known businessman, one of its most sought-after speakers, and a major voice in politics, culture, and international affairs.",
    "Faro Automated Solutions (FAS) is an American multinational corporate entity that produces robots for all walks of life, though its core business consists of military and defense contracts. As of 2063, FAS has ranked #1 among the Fortune 5 by gross revenue and profit for ten years in a row, a world record.  Founded in 2033 by Theodor “Ted” Faro, an entrepreneur from Salt Lake City, Utah, the company developed several promising robot prototypes in its early years but failed to break into markets dominated by then-industry giants like General Synthetics and RECorp. This changed in 2038 with the debut of the @lfred line of levitating personal servitors, which generated exceptional sales, lifting the company onto the Fortune 50 for the first time. Profits tripled in the 2040s as the company’s environmental efforts, led by famed engineer Elisabet Sobeck, catapulted FAS to the head of that sector. In 2049, in the wake of successful green and climate cleanup efforts around the globe, worldwide approval ratings of FAS exceeded 90% and founder Ted Faro was hailed across media and social networks as “the man who saved the world.” Yet it was the emergence of FAS as a military contractor in the late 2040s that cemented its status as the world’s wealthiest corporation, with a record market capitalization of over $23 trillion. By 2055, FAS controlled 61% of the market share for automated military platforms, holding contracts with 353 nations, trans-governmental organizations, and corporate entities. Today, its holdings exceed the second largest corporation (FBMobiHal Global) by 321%.",
    "Corporation (noun)\n\\kȯr-pə-ˈrā-shən\\\nAn association of individuals, created under authority of law, having existence, powers, and liabilities distinct from those of its members. In a business sense, a corporation is usually owned by shareholders, through the sale or distribution of stock, who profit from such ownership, vote at designated times for its governance, and designate executives who run its affairs. Most corporations engage in one or more industries to produce goods or offer services for profit, and may in turn own other corporations, companies, or property as holdings.",

Refreshments to be served before their 10:15 AM sales presentation on the Chariot line.\nPer instructions, food will be vegetarian only.\n\n10:07 AM \nSander Agnew, Vice President of Territorial Integrity from FreshGrounds Coffee Global arrived with his entourage. Refreshments to be served before their 10:30 AM sales presentation on the Chariot line. Per  instructions, will use FreshGrounds “Tacoma” blend, no artificial creamers.\n\n10:12 AM\nUh…so that happened. Called security. And janitorial, to clean up the coffee that was spilled – actually, more like thrown. I wasn’t aware that the Indo-Malay Combine grows coffee beans. And that FreshGrounds’ “acquisition team” has tried to take their fields, by force, repeatedly. I think Commandant Daing had Agnew by the hair for a second there. Who schedules these things? I’m going to drop a line to Sales. This can’t happen again.",

That would be me, Senior VP of Sales. Wanna know why? After that little hair-pulling incident, both sides increased their bids by 40%. \n\nI’ll explain, because your receptionist-level brain probably requires it. Those two sides are FIGHTING. And what do we sell? That’s right, COMBAT MACHINES. We WANT them to hate each other. So they will try to fight each other with… what? That’s right again, COMBAT MACHINES. Which they will pay us a lot of money for. \n\nSo I suggest you go back to serving coffee with a blank smile, and let me do my much-more-complicated job.\n\nThx a bunch,\nMr. Friedkin to you",
    "FROM: Stacy Anders \nTO: Robert Rescher\nSUBJECT: Dolphin Vid\n\nBob,\n\nAnother problem to add to our big steaming pile. Apparently a fisherman in the Banda Sea captured video of a Hartz-Timor Horus unit refueling via biomatter conversion along the shoreline of Pulau Wetar. On a pod of endangered dolphins, no less, quite possibly the last of their kind. Not to get graphic, but it looks like what happens inside a blender, as if the robot was whipping up a big pink swirling milkshake of dolphin chum. Our suppression team has scrubbed it from 43 networks, but it’s still propagating, so it’s only a matter of time before it goes viral. A prepared statement feels grossly insufficient. Any suggestions? This one’s a real stinker.\n\nStacy Anders\nVP/PR FAS",

Apparently there’s a little island paradise off the coast of Australia, population 2700, all of whom hate us, now that a stray Hartz-Timor unit is chowing down on their largest mango orchard. That brings the official count of Hart-Timor related lawsuits to 127, most of them from private companies, but also a bunch from individuals, nation states, and NGOs. And that’s not even counting the mother of all liability claims from Hartz itself. Call every external firm we’ve ever used, then call their competitors.

Not under any specific religious framework, of course, but in a more general sense, as in not giving enough thought to our shared values, hopes, and aspirations for the afterlife. I’d like you to reach out to religious leaders of every stripe with the intention of scheduling a conference soon. Very soon. I’ll have more thoughts about the agenda later, but for now, let’s put out some feelers and see if we can lock something in. Make it a big tent – no kooks, but anyone with a credible audience.

Stripping offshore wind farms for the OEZ, just me and a plasma cutter, 400 feet above sea level. Then I got the recall alert. Read them up on a turbine, in the smell of cooking ozone. They covered every angle – better pay, amnesty for any combine wars you’d fought in, guaranteed citizenship… We should have thought “OK, what’s the catch?” But what we did think was “I guess we’re better than the bots after all.” Big talk from Herres about pride and duty – smart guy. He was right. I’d been proud to be a U.S. soldier. I jumped at the chance to be one again. And look what I landed in.",

Magnetic. Optical. Quantum. Even that Eternity tech that FAS was shilling a year or so ago. But every other solution has one or more fatal shortcomings: too heavy to transport, too massive to install in the allotted space, too power-intensive over the centuries, too prone to failure past 300-400 years, et cetera. \n\nEncapsulated DNA will easily hold the 40+ zettabytes we’re projecting for APOLLO. There are still many details to finalize, of course. To start with, we need to select the inert material in which we’ll embed the molecules (already testing 16 candidate materials), as well as design and fabricate the power systems and sealed reliquaries that will keep the DNA at -18 degrees C for 1000+ years. \n\nSo long as I assure you that it didn’t factor in to my decision, may I confess that I deem it entirely fitting – indeed, propitious – that we will be using the very building blocks of life to preserve human knowledge from mechanized extinction?

The physical science modules are effectively “complete” with soft science modules close behind; world history, cultural data, and media archives are also on schedule.

    "Tate here. Just popped three blues, but I earned it. Finally figured out a Goldilocks solution to GAIA’s rather EXTREME executive authority. If that ain’t worth 10-12 hours of dreamtime, what is?\n\nBefore this, every usurpation protocol I designed failed in simulation cuz it was either too hard or too soft. \n\nTOO HARD, and it degraded the GAIA core. Sure, it pried Her figurative fingers off the figurative driving wheel so HADES could take control, but by breaking Her fingers – sometimes Her arms too. So that couldn’t fly. Everything depends on GAIA taking control back after HADES has done its business, so had to find a solution that didn’t leave GAIA any worse for the wear.  \n\nTOO SOFT, and GAIA only pretended to relinquish control. In simulation after simulation, HADES would take command of the terraforming system and reverse operations, only to have GAIA lurk in the background, quietly re-reversing processes and falsifying telemetry to hide its interference.

I swear, ain’t nothing GAIA wouldn’t do to keep life going – even when it’s just simulated plant life. \n\nTurns out the “JUST RIGHT” solution is to isolate GAIA in a protective code shell, preserving its integrity, then “un-seat” it from command position so HADES can slip into the figurative captain’s chair and work its magic.

    "FROM: Patrick Brochard-Klein\nTO:  Elisabet Sobeck\nSUBJECT: Cradle Servitor Personae\n\nDevelopment of the artificial personae for Cradle servitors – nurturer, disciplinarian, healer – continues at a good pace. We are targeting Turing 0.4 for these constructs; this should allow low-grade empathy and limited improvisation without undermining adherence to codified behavior sets. \n\nThe stimulus-driven switching of personae, however, is proving to be a greater software challenge than anticipated. Especially concerning are entrenched feedback loops between the disciplinarian and healer personae.\n\nI have also attached the reports from an incident where a servitor running the mother personae intervened on a disciplinarian servitor’s behavior. A parental argument, if you will. Amusing on first glance, perhaps, but deeply concerning.\n\nI have attached a comprehensive plan for correcting these interactive protocol shortcomings. In just...

    "FROM: Patrick Brochard-Klein\nTO: Elisabet Sobeck\nSUBJECT: FZ Chambers\n\nThe ectogenic chambers arrived two days ago. \n\nI’ve spent the last 36 hours examining them and poring over technical documentation. \n\nThey’re a revelation. Astonishing. \n\nI don’t know what you had to give Far Zenith in trade to get these chambers – but it was worth it. In a single leap, their embryologists have vaulted past fifty years of technological shortcomings. The risks of ECMO – resolved. Nutrition delivery – resolved. Hormonal stability – resolved. Twelve other risk areas – resolved. \n\nBefore I examined these chambers, I considered the Odyssey to be a fool’s errand. But if the rest of FZ’s technology is at this level, well… a human colony around Sirius doesn’t seem so impossible after all. \n\nMass fabrication of the chambers will present a number of challenges, but I’m confident they can be resolved. I’m going to rest for a few hours, then get back to it. Expect a fabrication plan within 48 hours.\n\nPBK",
    "FROM: Elisabet Sobeck\nTO: All-Alphas\nSUBJECT: Odyssey Has Failed\n\nAll, \n\nSome terrible news, I’m afraid. Far Zenith has informed me that the Odyssey mission has failed. Last night, telemetry indicated a catastrophic antimatter containment failure as the drives spun up to depart the solar system. The ship, its crew, its cargo of zygotes and seeds, its alpha-build of APOLLO – all were lost. \n\nZero Dawn is now the only hope for the continuation of the human species and Earthly life. \n\nWe must succeed.\n\nElisabet",
    "FROM: Charles Ronson\nTO: Elisabet Sobeck\nSUBJECT: ARTEMIS status\n\nIt’s coming along, Lis, I’m positive about it, if those words can still mean anything. Had my sleeves rolled up negotiating with frozen zoos for their samples – so many species trapped in ghoulish hologram dioramas, suspended in ‘what if’s – more than fourteen thousand that went extinct between 2000 and 2043 – \n\nWe’ve started mapping out primary succession, selecting the pioneer organisms for a balanced and sustainable biosphere – microorganisms and insects, rabbits and hawks, foxes and wolves. Thousands more that will have to wait their turn until our new generation can be entrusted with the duty of restoring them. So they can return to a world that – this time! – will understand the concept of conservation before it’s too late.\n\nThere’s already been too many too lates. We lost a whole collection team during the swarm breakthrough in Myanmar. The samples we lost were… well, irreplaceable.\n\nBut thanks to you, Lis, the circle of life will bend, not break. The Earth was a lifeless rock before, and some day it will be again. But not now, not like this. Not on our watch.\n\nRonson.",

    "Just wrapped inspection of GAIA Prime site. Construction is well underway, reactor installed. Plans for control room remind me of starship bridges on those cheesy old SF vids. Living spaces for Alphas already completed – prefab modules. Fingers crossed we never have to seal ourselves in here… not that Elysium sounds much better. \n\nSpent last week at the Bryce site, designing ZD project labs, drawing up protocols. The base we’re repurposing was huge – plenty of room for work spaces and residence blocks. The work crews already set up my office/lab. I’m not a fan of the glass wall. Guess Murray’s intention was to ensconce me as “all-seeing presence.” Ugh. Opposite effect. Makes me feel watched, on display. Tempted to paint it over. \n \nHerres recorded his presentation yesterday. Suitably bleak. Scheduled to record mine Friday.\n\nAs soon as reception, lounge, holo theaters, and first residence block at ZD site are finished we’ll start processing the candidates being held outside Tucson – 27 already. Extraction teams prioritizing Pac Rim & Aussie candidates. How scared & confused they must be, snatched off the street, carted across the world, held in cells. Here’s hoping they understand once they see the big picture. \n \nGoing to catch a few hours sleep here, then fly back to the ZD site. Herres promised delivery of qb lattices by noon. Expect Mk1 will take two weeks to machine, assemble, and test. I aim to launch GAIA at 0.6T grounding. From there I’ll spin her up past 1.0T. Wonder how long it’ll take to break the 1.38T record. MIE can go hang. \n \nSleep. ",
    "Last time I visited Prime was November of last year. Months since have been a blur. Flew out last night to oversee installation of the central armature and the master override (you’re welcome, Ted) which was completed by 0430. So I decided to grab a few hours of sleep here before heading back to ZD. Called GAIA before I bedded down, ostensibly to update her on the site plan. But the truth is, I missed her. I’ve developed a habit of speaking to her before I sleep. Seems to be the only thing that calms me these days. \n\nWoke to a message from Osvald. The Odyssey launched yesterday. So terrestrial life’s chance of survival has doubled. Why, then, do I feel so uneasy? I just keep wondering what kind of world Far Zenith will create if the ship reaches its destination so many decades from now. And I worry about that alpha-build of APOLLO. So much knowledge, so few restraints, and no fail-safes. How will they avoid repeating our mistakes? What’s to stop them from playing god? \n\nForwarded the Odyssey message to the Alphas. Naoto replied in less than a minute – with a poem, of course. “The Building of the Ship” by Longfellow – and it’s loooong, all right. I didn’t read all of it, but it seems to be about launching a ship, rather than building one. This stanza (or couplet, or whatever) leapt out at me: \n\nHumanity, with all its fears, \nWith all its hopes of future years, \nIs hanging breathless on thy fate! \n\nYeah, Odyssey and Zero Dawn both. Speaking of which, I should get back to ZD. Guess I should stop by  Naoto’s lab and check on DEMETER’s progress, too. If I can get out of there without a volume of Tennyson pressed into my hands, I’ll count myself lucky. \n\n‘Til next time. \n",
    "Halloween. \n\nTravis came by trick-or-treating – dressed up like me. Should’ve seen that coming. I gave him a half-eaten packet of dandy wafers as a “treat” and kicked him out… but not before he invited me to some kind of “Italian horror extravaganza” he organized for ZD staff. Seriously. As though there isn’t enough horror in the world already. \n\nAnyway, I was already scheduled to fly out here to G Prime for final inspections with Herres and the President’s delegation. Ted was here, too, and he was not looking good. Kept fidgeting and couldn’t seem to look me in the face without blinking. I was relieved when he boarded his vert and flew back to “Thebes” (gag). Though I guess I shouldn’t complain… if he wants to build himself a “deluxe shelter” to ride out the apocalypse, let him. Keeps him out of Elysium and away from me.\n \nHerres stuck around long enough to give me a detailed briefing on the strategic situation. Basically,  we’ve entered the terminal phase. (As though the color of the sky when I was flying over here wasn’t clue enough.) Another two or three weeks, and the atmosphere won’t be breathable. The last vestiges of European and West-African civ brigades are trapped with their backs against the Atlantic. The swarm that scuttled across Antarctica is crossing the straits of Magellan, about to start its death crawl up South America towards the Amazon. (All the work we did to reconstitute the rain forest… and it comes to this.) And advance elements of the Pacific swarms are already skirmishing with units on the Cal-Mar seawall. \n\nThe noose is tightening. Projections show we can still finish in time, but the margin of error is +/- 10 days – not a good spread. If the plague breaks through ahead of schedule… Well, it just can’t. I will not let that happen. \n \nEnough writing. I need to get back to Zero Dawn. ",
    "Such a close thing. \n  \nIt’s been, what, 43 hours since Herres warned me? Said collapse of the eastern line was imminent, swarms launching some kind of pincer maneuver vs. the Wichita salient. \n \nFive or six days more and I think GAIA could have launched without our help. I really do. \n \nWe had to scramble. ZD became a madhouse. Absolute bedlam, every team rushing to stabilize code and lock it down as Gammas got evacuated, then Betas. \n \nOnce GAIA was on her way, I gathered the Alphas together to give them the bad news. Felt like I was going to throw up. But they already knew, of course. They knew the work wasn’t really finished. Close, but not quite there. Still tests to run, kinks to smooth – work to do. So they accepted it. No Elysium for us. We’ll spend the rest of our lives here, testing and polishing each subordinate function to perfection.  \n \nGuess that’s what you get when you recruit a bunch of obsessive perfectionists. Managed not to cry until I got back to my office.  \n \nSo here we are, setting up GAIA Prime. And yeah, such a close thing. Makes me feel nauseated all over again when I contemplate how the fate of life could hinge on coincidence. If I’d never proposed the Lightkeeper protocol, there never would have been living spaces constructed here. If I’d abandoned the protocol sooner, the necessary life support systems never would have been installed. IF, IF, IF. At least we won’t have to endure the creepiness of raising and training clones of ourselves. The genetic material was never processed out of the cradle sites, so it’s not even possible. For which I’m glad. I really, really wouldn’t want to spend time around a young Travis Tate raised by Travis Tate. No, it’ll be up to us to perfect GAIA, one generation only.  \n  \nUpdate: That was General Herres. The salient has collapsed. USRC expects to be overrun in two days, which gives us 72 hours at best to lock down and seal up.\n \nBuried alive – for life’s sake. \n \nI’ll go tell the others. ",

By using a flexible nano-fiber weave instead of plating, and enhancing protection with a 400 eV hard light micro-projector, we’ve reduced our testing cycle from weeks to days, and I’m confident we can get the suit out by next month, with enough production to cover dozens of elite units, at least. Better yet, it will be half the weight, half the cost, and offer twice the mobility. All we need is the balance of our funding, a few more techs, and another experienced test subject.

    "Elisabet Sobeck: Okay, GAIA. Sorry about that. Where was I?\n\nGAIA: You were telling a story.\n\nElisabet Sobeck: Right. Yeah… so, like I was saying, it was a children’s electronics kit, but I’d hacked the wiring to an auto battery and solar PV, so the grass caught fire. And so did a tall pine that’d stood there, I don’t know, maybe a hundred years.\n\nGAIA: Query: You were how old?\n\nElisabet Sobeck: Six. My mother was home, thank god, so she called the fire department and after, she took me out on the lawn and showed me the dead baby birds. Because there were nests in the pine tree.\n\nGAIA: Query: What did you feel?\n\nElisabet Sobeck: I'm not sure. I remember yelling that I didn't care. And that’s when my mother took my face in her hands and… spoke.\n\nGAIA: Query: What did she say?\n\nElisabet Sobeck: She said I had to care. She said, “Elisabet, being smart will count for nothing if you don’t make the world better.” Elisabet Sobeck: ” You have to use your smarts to count for something, to serve life, not death.” \n\nGAIA: You often tell stories of your mother. But you are childless.\n\nElisabet Sobeck: I never had time. I guess it was for the best.\n\nGAIA: If you had had a child, Elisabet, what would you have wished for him or her?\n\nElisabet Sobeck: I guess… I would have wanted her to be… curious. And willful – unstoppable, even… but with enough compassion to… heal the world… just a little bit. \n\nElisabet Sobeck: Anyway, that’s all I’ve got for now, GAIA.
