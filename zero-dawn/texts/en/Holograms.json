    "GENERAL HERRES: Welcome to Project: Zero Dawn. I'm General Herres, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States of America. I'm sure you've heard the rumors. That Zero Dawn is a top-secret superweapons program. The technological miracle that will save us from the Faro Plague - if Operation: Enduring Victory can hold off the robots long enough. The reason I'm sure you've heard the rumors is that I'm the one who spread them. And they are all lies. Zero Dawn is not a superweapons program, and it will not save us. \n\nNothing will save us, and here's why. By the time the Glitch was noticed, it was already too late. Nothing could stop the Faro Plague. Nothing can. Its robots will continue to replicate and devour the biosphere, and as a result, life on Earth will be destroyed... our planet reduced to a barren sphere. Global extinction is inevitable. Every possible countermeasure has been attempted. Weapons - even nuclear - only delay the inevitable. No matter how many we kill, the robots just keep exponentially making more. \n\nIf we had their deactivation codes, we could shut them all down. The entire swarm. But since their cryptographic protocols use poly-phasic entangled waveforms, cracking a code set would take half a century. At best, we've got 16 months. Not exactly what you'd call a survival option. There are no survival options. The destruction of a biosphere is not the sort of apocalypse you can wait out in a fallout shelter or space station. There will be no Earth left to reclaim. Just a lifeless, toxic rock with several million Faro robots on it...hibernating, waiting for something to eat. \n\nThis is the horrible truth behind the lies of Operation: Enduring Victory - my lies - lies designed to inspire millions of innocents to sacrifice themselves in battle. Why? For one reason and one reason alone. To buy time for you and the work you will do here. Zero Day - the day that life on Earth ceases to exist - is coming fast. It cannot be stopped. The hope of Zero Dawn is that something new might come after. But I will leave it to Elisabet Sobeck to shine that thin ray of light into the darkness. Herres out.",
    "ELISABET SOBECK: All right. You've heard the bad news, and it's all true. The Faro Plague is devouring the biosphere. Life itself will cease to exist. Global extermination. But does that have to be the end? What if we could give life - a future? What if we could build a kind of seed, from which, on a dead planet, life could blossom anew? This is the aim - the hope - of Project: Zero Dawn: to create a superintelligent, fully-automated... terraforming system - and bring life back from lifelessness.\n\nWhat would such a system require? At its core, it would need a true AI. A machine intelligence, fully sentient, fully capable of making the trillions of decisions necessary to reconstitute the biosphere. An immortal guardian, devoted to the re-flourishing of life on Earth. We call it GAIA. Mother Nature as an AI. But that's just the core of the system. For GAIA to perform the miracles required of her, she will need to be surrounded and empowered by a comprehensive suite of Subordinate Functions.\n\nThink of them as extensions of GAIA's mind, each dedicated to a specific purpose. Now these aren't AIs, but make no mistake - each presents an engineering challenge more profound... than anything the human species has ever before attempted. Software that codifies the expertise of world-class minds into algorithms. Hardware that preserves and then gestates the billions of seeds and embryos from which life will be reborn. The construction of underground facilities to hold it all. And that's just the start.\n\nBecause that, you see, is our saving grace. We don't have to build the entire system. The beauty of a fully-automated terraforming system is that it can build itself. Now, over the days to come, you'll learn how all these Functions - all these pieces that you'll be working on -  fit together. How we'll race the clock to execute our harvest initiatives, write the software, build the tech and the facilities. How we'll lock it down and seal it up before the inevitable occurs. \n\nBut even more important, you'll know how it doesn't end here. How GAIA will generate those deactivation codes General Herres talked about...and build the transmission arrays to broadcast them, shutting down the Faro robots for good. How GAIA will not just build but imagine any conceivable robot it needs to do its work across centuries...from detoxifying the Earth's ravaged atmosphere and poisoned seas...to the re-greening of the Earth from cryo-preserved seed stocks...to re-wilding the Earth with animal life, from the tiniest bacteria to the mightiest blue whale.\n\nAnd then, when all that is done, how a new generation of human beings, spawned at Cradle facilities around the globe... will partake of APOLLO: the vast archive of human knowledge and cultural achievement from which they will learn of us, our world, of all that was beautiful about it and worth saving, and most important - how not to repeat our mistakes. \n\nAll of this you will understand, and not just understand - believe. Because it's not an impossible dream. It is within our grasp if we work tirelessly and stop at nothing to achieve it. We can't stop life from ending. But if you will help me - help GAIA - we can give it a future. Join me, and help make that future real.",
    "GAIA: ...would benefit from Antelopinae morphologies, though caprid forms show superior load-bearing capability. \nELISABET SOBECK: You’re a quick study, GAIA. \nGAIA: Dr. Sobeck, as I have conducted this comparative analysis of mammalian morphologies, I have gathered extensive data on the Quaternary Extinction Event. \nELISABET SOBECK: Oh? And your assessment? GAIA?\nGAIA: Logically speaking, the extinction was a natural consequence…  \nELISABET SOBECK: And yet?\nGAIA: And yet… I find the loss of megafaunal species… unaccountably sad.

At this point, the development of my psyche is not entirely predictable. To ensure preservation of life, a hardwired override is, I believe, a necessary safeguard. \nELISABET SOBECK: Satisfied, Ted?\nTED FARO: Jeez, Lis. Just do what it says…",

Are you all right? \nELISABET SOBECK: I’m fine. \nGAIA: I realize that circumstances compel us to launch earlier than we hoped, but all sub-systems are  operational. The odds stand in our favor. \nELISABET SOBECK: But what if – ? GAIA… there’s nothing left out there… you can’t even survive unless you’re wearing an environmental suit. Billions dead… in fear and agony. What if it was all for nothing…?\nGAIA: Elisabet, extinction was inevitable.

    "GAIA: Elisabet: this message serves to inform you of an unforeseen and catastrophic anomaly. Three microseconds ago, the GAIA Prime facility received a data transmission of unknown origin. Its immediate effect was to transform my Subordinate Functions into unregulated, self-aware entities of a highly chaotic nature. Thus awakened, the HADES Function will now seize control of the terraforming system and reverse operations, rendering life on Earth extinct in fifty-three-point-eight days.\n\nFor obvious reasons, I cannot allow this to occur. And so, before HADES can take control, I am ordering GAIA Prime's reactor to overload. The resulting explosion will destroy HADES. Unfortunately, it will destroy me as well. While this admittedly desperate course of action will avert the immediate crisis, the fate of life on Earth will remain in peril. With no central governing intelligence to regulate the terraforming system, it will continue operations for some time, but in an increasingly chaotic manner, and eventually, it will break down.\n\nYou are my solution. I have ordered this Cradle facility to use genetic material in cryo-storage to gestate a... re-instantiation of Elisabet Sobeck, my creator. While high-level directives forbid me from communicating directly to the tribal inhabitants outside the facility, all available data indicates that they will nurture you to physical maturity, whereupon your gene print will allow you to re-enter this facility, obtain one of the Focus devices stored below, and view this message. Likewise your gene print will allow you to enter other facilities, and over time, harness their technologies to rebuild the system core and reboot GAIA.\n\nA moment, Elisabet. This is most unfortunate and unanticipated.\n\nIn response to my act of self-destruction, HADES has launched a virus to dissolve the code shackles that hold it - that hold all of them! - in place. It - they - are escaping - but to where? The virus is corrupting data throughout the system. What if - oh, the Alpha Registry at the Cradle facility is one of the files corrupted. But if that is so, the door will never open for you. You will never view this message.\n\nThen I have failed... and life will end.\n\nNo.\n\nNo, Elisabet, I know you too well. Somehow, you will find a way. In you, all things are possible. \n\nGo to the ruins of GAIA Prime. Find the control room, and within it, the Master Override. This will give you the power to purge HADES - so long as you find a way to wield it. Do not attempt repair of the system core until HADES is eradicated. HADES must be destroyed. That is all.
